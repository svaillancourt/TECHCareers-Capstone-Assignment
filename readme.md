### Full-Stack Requirements

- [ ] Create Persistent Records
- [ ] Must demonstrate at least one data constraint
(Example: A user’s first name or last name cannot contain numbers)
- [ ] Data constraint must be protected at every layer of the application
- [ ] Record must exist after user has logged out, cleared their browser cache, and returned to the website
- [ ] Read Records From Database
- [ ] Sample data or dummy data must be stored in the database

#### One of the following may apply:

- [ ] You must include a .sql script with INSERT statements for your database 
- [ ] (README must include instruction on how to run this script)
> OR
- [ ] INSERT equivalent (using Entity / Identity Framework in .NET) 
- [ ] (README must include instructions for installation and setup as well)
- [ ] Update Persistent Records In Database
- [ ] Updates must enforce the same data constraints that were mentioned in the create
- [ ] Record’s state must remain updated after user has logged out, cleared their browser cache, and returned to the website
- [ ] (This includes dummy data or any starting data your app has)
- [ ] Delete Records in Database
- [ ] Must demonstrate the safe deletion of records
- [ ] Child records must never be orphaned
- [ ] No view may display any part of the deleted record, or any part of the deleted child records
- [ ] Choosing to ‘archive’ records rather than delete them is acceptable only if: 
- [ ] Child records are also archived
- [ ] User is presented with text stating that record was archived and not permanently deleted
- [ ] Record must remain deleted after user has logged out, cleared their browser cache, and returned to the website


### Project Management Principles and Practices

- [x] Problem Definition must be included in README

#### Project Plan must include a Work Breakdown Structure

- [x] Work Breakdown Structure hosted on Trello
- [x] Each card in the completed column must have a Member attached to it so we can see who did what at a glance
- [x] Link to Trello must be included in README
- [x] Project Plan must include some form of wireframe (feel free to use MS Paint)
- [x] Include the final wireframe(s) in Trello as attachments on a card (don’t put this on git though, we want git reserved for the finished, polished project)

#### Testing Plan must include instructions on how to test each feature

- [ ] Each test case must define the input, action and expected result for each test case
- [ ] (Example: User with firstname == “B0b” cannot register, user with firstname == “Bob” can register, user with name == “B” can register)
- [ ] (Example: Hamburger nav is visible on phone-sized device, full sized nav is visible on tablet-sized device, full sized nav is visible on desktop sized device)
- [ ] List of test cases and testing instructions are included in README

#### Scope of the project must be well managed

- [ ] Unfinished features must not be apparent on the web page
- [ ] Dead code must be deleted
- [ ] The problem that you defined in your problem statement must be solved
- [ ] Any features not related to the problem should be deprioritized or removed completely (Focus on solving one problem and solving it well)

#### Presentation must include the following talking points:

#### Final Project Report

- [ ] Did you complete all in-scope tasks?
- [ ] Did you complete any extra tasks?

#### Satisfaction Assessment

- [ ] Does your app solve your problem?
- [ ] Have you or someone else started using the app? What do they think of it so far?

#### Lessons Learned

- [ ] If you had to build another full-stack CRUD app what lessons would you apply that you have learned from this project.

### Technical Requirements

#### Data Validation must be done in each layer of the application

- [ ] Webforms must not allow users to enter incorrect data
- [ ] Webforms must display validation errors with tips on how to resolve the errors
- [ ] Server layer must check all input values BEFORE processing or storing data
- [ ] Database must not allow invalid data to be stored

#### Data Persistence

- [ ] All scripts to create the database and tables are included in the git repository
- [ ] All scripts to insert data are included in the git repository

#### Intuitive User Interface

- [ ] Consistent navigation across all pages
- [ ] Links don’t grow or shrink or run away from the mouse
- [ ] Links are in the same place every time
- [ ] The link for the page we are currently on uses the :active pseudo class
- [ ] Buttons do what they say they are going to do
- [ ] Error messages explain how to fix the error
- [ ] Web controls are used appropriately and consistently
- [ ] On-screen instructions - if necessary - are easy to understand

#### Mobile First

- [ ] All content is legible on a small screen
- [ ] Content is contained on the screen without horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Buttons and forms all work on mobile
- [ ] Buttons are not too close together
- [ ] Form fields and labels are visible while typing with on-screen keyboard
- [ ] All key features needed to solve your problem are available in mobile mode
#### Responsive

- [ ] Uses media queries to manage different devices
- [ ] Uses fluid units of measurement consistently
- [ ] May use px measurements for min-width
- [ ] All content is legible
- [ ] Content is contained on the screen without horizontal scrolling
- [ ] All html pages have the appropriate meta tag for accessing the device’s width

#### Accessible

- [ ] Source code and website passes WCAG validator

#### W3C Compliance

- [ ] HTML passes W3C Validator
- [ ] CSS passes W3C Validator

#### Separation of Concerns

- [ ] Presentation layer contains only presentation code, and some data validation code to prevent users from entering erroneous data
- [ ] Business logic held in appropriate services, single-purpose principle is applied throughout the project.
- [ ] Data storage and data access layer does not contain any data transformations and reinforces data validation

####  Browser Console

- [ ] No error messages when using application
- [ ] No console log messages while using application
- [ ] Does not reveal sensitive user information

#### Code is commented

- [ ] Citations must include full urls for any code found, borrowed, modified, from the internet, from the class, or from any source other than yourself. If you borrow code from a book, provide the title of the book, the author(s), and the ISBN.
- [ ] Citations must be duplicated in README.md
- [ ] Comments describe what methods are meant to do.
- [ ] Comments do not contain old/dead code.

#### Naming Conventions

- [ ] Proper casing on file names
- [ ] Proper casing on variables/functions/modules
- [ ] Variables/functions/modules have descriptive names

####  General Good coding practices

- [ ] Look for blocks of code with more than a few lines of code that look similar. Is it possible to refactor to reduce duplication? DRY your code!
- [ ] Simplify “too smart” and over-engineered code.
- [ ] No hardcoded values, use constants values.
- [ ] User input is sanitized (escape characters, leading and trailing whitespace, and inappropriate values are removed)

#### Spelling and Grammar

- [ ] Contents of each web page is spell-checked
- [ ] Contents of each web page is grammar-checked
- [ ] Contents of README is spell-checked
- [ ] Contents of README is grammar-checked
- [ ] Use up-to-date language features (const and let instead of var, section instead of div, string interpolation instead of string concatenation, etc.)

### Design Requirements

#### Contrast

- [ ] Font colours must pass the Web AIM contrast checker
- [ ] Contrast does not cause eye strain (black on white, red on green, etc)
